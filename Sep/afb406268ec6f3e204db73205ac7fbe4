Durban - The Jagroop brothers, Ashen and Ranvir, have brought double honours to their family at Regent Business School’s recent graduation ceremony.
Both graduated with BCom honours degrees. Ashen, 38, who graduated cum laude in purchasing management, said it had been an incredible journey for them. “It was great that we could share that experience and I’m sure it was a great experience for our parents to witness both their sons get their honours together on the same day.” Ranvir, 25, who studied operations management, added: “Our family are our biggest blessing and supporters and they encouraged us to further our studies.” Ashen relocated to Johannesburg from Chatsworth 20 years ago and Ranvir followed two years ago. Said Ranvir: “I work for an airline company as an operations officer. There are more international airlines at OR Tambo International Airport than at King Shaka, which means better opportunities for me.” Ashen added that he felt it was time for him to give his career a boost. “I work as a strategic planning and marketing executive for a leading toy distributor. I attend a lot of programmes and events and there was one event happening in Africa. “I wanted to attend but I needed an honours degree. I was so disappointed that I immediately picked up the phone and called Regent.” They said they were always looking for opportunities to better themselves and through this, they were able to strengthen their bond.
