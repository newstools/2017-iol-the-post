Durban - The South African Women’s Indoor Cricket team did not allow its 69 run loss to Australia at the Indoor World Cup in Dubai on Saturday to dampen their mood when they returned home this week. They instead looked optimistic despite having lost this and six previous World Cup finals, all to Australia, since they began competing in 1998. The 12-member squad mustered a paltry 52 runs (all out) in response to the Aussies 121 at the Insportz Club. Team manager Mike Wenk said although they had about eight months of training, the team excelled. “These 12 ladies came out guns blazing since day one of the tournament. For eight of them, it was their first World Cup. They destroyed England and beat New Zealand in the semi-finals until they faced Australia,” said Wenk. When team SA arrived at the OR Tambo International Airport on Monday, about 100 supporters, Wenk said, greeted them with balloons and flowers. Bowler and batswoman, 27-year-old Nadine Moodley, of Chatsworth, who represented South Africa for the first time, said: “We played exceptionally well and gave it our all. "It was an incredible feeling to reach the finals and go up against Australia." POST
