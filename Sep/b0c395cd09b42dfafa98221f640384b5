LETTER - Silverglen is reeling. Ruthless killers have bloodied the green neighbourhood, snuffing out the life of one of its well-known citizens. The four killers, posing as prospective buyers for the house, sat and had tea and cake and then showed their gratitude by pulling out their knives and plunging them into the elderly couple. Former Southlands School principal Gona Pillay was fatally stabbed and her husband critically wounded. What threat could a terrified, elderly couple pose to four adult men? As it was planned, couldn’t they have locked the couple in the bathroom, ransacked the house and left with their booty? And what man would stab a defenceless woman? But how dumb of the trainee estate agent? Couldn't he realise that he would be the first suspect? Perhaps he’s already got his defence. He didn’t know that the "buyers" he took to the Pillays’ house were killers. Those familiar with the criminal mind will tell you that such ruthless killers do not have the milk of human compassion. For them, to show mercy is not manly. It's a sign of weakness. So should society show compassion to such dangerous criminals? If caught and convicted, should they be jailed at the taxpayers' expense? Is the criminal more important than the victim? POST
