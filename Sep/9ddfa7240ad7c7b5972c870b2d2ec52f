Durban - With over 8000 likes and 9000 followers in less than six months, The Socialpreneur Facebook page has been making waves on social media.
The page displays a number of humorous and tongue-in-cheek videos and photographs on topics that involve Indian communities. Page creator, Zameer Shaik, formerly from Newlands West, in Durban, said: “I play two characters, a Durban Indian named OG 2 Scoops and a Joburg Indian, who is The Socialpreneur. “I created this fictional character, OG 2 Scoops, to bring humour to my videos. He is the guy that says anything he wants and behaves how ever he feels, while The Socialpreneur is the professional that co-ordinates what goes on.” Shaik, who lives in Johannesburg and runs a social media agency, says he uses comedy and humour to engage with his audience and promote local businesses. “I am using my marketing intelligence to promote and support local businesses, local talent and everything local to grow.” Shaik said he thought of the most outrageous topics or what he had experienced or seen when creating videos and memes. “I think about whether people would find it funny and interesting first before I create my videos. I always try to keep a positive vibe. “And I create memes from what I find on the internet and the content is usually something that is trending on social media or something people will relate to.” The 32-year-old is planning to get more involved in YouTube.
