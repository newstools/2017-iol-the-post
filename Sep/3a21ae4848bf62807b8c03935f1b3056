Cape Town - Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas have met with KPMG International on Thursday. But while they have agreed to meet with KPMG, they have indicated that they reserve their legal rights. John Veihmeyer led the delegation and newly-appointed CEO for KPMG South Africa, Nhlamu Dlomu was also in attendance. "We shared our strong feelings and disapproval of the manner in which KPMG SA has been involved in the validation of state capture and corruption in respect of both the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and companies of the Gupta family. KPMG has a moral duty to account for their conduct to the South African public and they have to be frank and transparent in their disclosures if they wish to restore their own reputation," said Pravin Gordhan in a statement. Gordhan and Jonas demanded a full disclosure on the role of parties in the state capture project. "Clearly, given the inadequacy of their earlier statement on Friday last week, further steps need to be taken by KPMG to be more open and frank with South Africans." The embattled audit firm last week let go of its chief executive, chief operating officer, board chairperson and six other partners after the firm admitted that its probe for the work it did for the Gupta companies and SARS’ “rogue unit” report had “fallen short” of its standards. The firm is also set to repay the R23 million in fees it earned from SARS and donate a further R40m it earned from the Guptas to anti-corruption activities. IOL
