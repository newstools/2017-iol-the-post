The alleged leader of Cape Town’s Sexy Boys gang, Jerome “Donkie” Booysen, was one of several people shot in Ravensmead last night in an incident in which one person died. Booysen is believed to have been wounded in the neck. His lawyer, Pete Mihalik, confirmed the shooting but did not have other details. Police said last night an attempted murder case was opened for investigation. “Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident at about 7.15pm in 40th Street, Eureka Estate, Ravensmead where a 52-year-old man was injured are under investigation. An attempted murder case was opened for investigation,” said police spokesperson FC van Wyk. Three years ago evidence was heard in the Cape Town Regional Court implicating Booysen as being part of Specialised Protection Services, which at that point had provided security to 156 entertainment venues in the Western Cape with 258 bouncers. The company was deregistered because it was not a member of the statutory body regulating private security, Psira. Businessman Mark Liffman and former SPS boss Andre Naude, close associates of Booysen, were later acquitted on 313 counts, including for contravening the private security regulatory act. Booysen was also a suspect in the death of another underworld figure, Cyril Beeka, who died in a hail of bullets in 2011. Beeka had returned from visiting Booysen in Bellville when his vehicle came under fire from a gunman on a motorcycle on Jake Gerwel Drive in front of the University of the Western Cape. The man believed to be part of a new grouping which has taken over security at most of Cape Town’s nightclubs, Nafiz Modack, confirmed last night that he had also heard of the shootings. Last week four people were killed and 11 wounded as rival gangs battled it out over drug turf in Elsies River, not far from where Booysen was shot.
