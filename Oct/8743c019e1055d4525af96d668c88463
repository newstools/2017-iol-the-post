Gauteng - With just a month to go before the Mrs South Africa pageant, 29-year-old Reevana Govender is all geared up. The Northriding, Johannesburg, mother of one, will vie for the coveted title on November 17 at Emperor’s Palace in Gauteng. The optometrist said she was excited and had been busy preparing since her selection in April. “I have been on the most wonderful journey of self-growth and empowerment," said Govender. Almost R1 million in prizes can be won in the competition. Beauty pageants are nothing new for the born and raised Port Shepstone beauty, who is the current Empress India South Africa 2016 title holder and the second runner-up for Mrs India Worldwide. With a thriving career and being a wife and mother, Govender said it was difficult to strike a balance but she had a supportive family, who always encouraged her to soar to new heights. As an optometrist, Govender intends on raising awareness around eye care for school-going children. "As a mother, I want to empower other moms. We have a huge social responsibility as we are raising the future generation of the world. "We should raise our daughters to know that they are strong and we should raise our sons to be respectful and supportive of strong women." Govender described her husband, 31-year-old Chandresan Govender, a former Lotus FM and Eastern Mosaic presenter, as her biggest fan, most honest critic and most loyal supporter. The couple have a 2-year-old daughter, Mayil. "He is a hands-on father and I could not imagine doing any of this without him." POST
