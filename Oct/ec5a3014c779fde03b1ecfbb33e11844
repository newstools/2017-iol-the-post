Durban - The 13th annual Durban Diwali Festival, hosted by the SA Hindu Maha Sabha (Sahms), from October 13 to 15, is expected to be bigger and better than ever. The event, which will take place at the Durban drive-in site, is themed Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family). Visitors can expect entertainment, religious programmes, shopping and a food fair. The highlights include a dance workshop and competition, Odissi dance performances courtesy of the Indian consulate, and a Lotus FM bhangra bash. The float procession, on October 14, will start at 10am from Dr Goonam (Prince Edward) Street and will end at the festival site. Festival director Neeran Besesar said: “It would be appreciated if organisations could build their floats with this year’s theme in mind. Organisations wishing to participate without a float are most welcome to walk with the procession and be part of the fun.” He advised participants to set up early. Besesar added that a free shuttle service would be available from the site to the starting point, from 7.30am until 9.30am. The havan ceremony, he said, was scheduled for October 15 in the main tent from 10am. “All organisations and members are welcome to participate in this spiritual offering.” Bhajans and kirtans precede the havan. All prayer items will be provided at no charge. For enquiries, call the Sahms offices at 031 309 1951. The Durban Diwali Festival is scheduled for October 13 to 15. POST
