Durban - Do you smack, spank or pinch your wayward child to instil discipline? Think again. A landmark Gauteng High Court ruling makes any form of physical punishment at home illegal. Parents could previously defend the use of moderate, or reasonable chastisement, but they now can face charges of physical assault. The nature of the child's transgression, the motive of the parent, the force and object used to mete out punishment, as well as the age, gender and size of the child, had to be taken into consideration, the court said. Religious leaders had mixed feelings about the judgment. Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier, Archbishop of Durban, said the Bible was clear. “If you spare the rod you spoil the child. “Personally I believe that screaming and shouting does more damage to your child, than a little spanking,” he said. “With that said, it depends on how some parents interpret spanking. Some use it as an excuse for physical abuse, and that can never be tolerated on any level. However, a little smack on the bum never hurt anyone.” Ashwin Trikamjee, president of the SA Hindu Maha Sabha (SAHMS) supported the judgment. “The SAHMS completely supports the law which makes any kind of corporal punishment illegal,” he said. “The arguments that permeate every now and then by those in favour is analogous to the law against the death penalty. There is no place in our society for either.” Moulana Abdullah Khan from KZN’s Jamiat-ul-Ulama said corporal punishment at any level is not allowed in Islam, especially when it comes to severe physical abuse. “In Islam, disciplining your child is allowed, but within limits. You cannot hit your child in an attempt to vent out your frustration and for a personal motive,” he said. “Prophet Muhammad has given us guidelines on how to teach children and parents need to educate themselves and how to positively discipline and reprimand.” ChristianView Network condemned the ruling, calling for the removal of the judge from the Bench.
