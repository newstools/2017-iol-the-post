The Somerset Park mother of two selflessly distracted the thieves as her husband and children took refuge in a bedroom. Shutting the door behind him to prevent the four men entering, Poovan Govender dived for the panic button to alert their security company. He said the men, dressed in hats and “dust masks”, entered the property after derailing the driveway gate. “We were sitting in the lounge when we heard someone trying to break through our front door. I immediately ran for the panic button in my mom’s bedroom and my kids followed. My wife, who was in shock, remained in the living room.” Govender said it seemed the men had known exactly how long it would take for security to respond. “In a matter of five minutes they ransacked the house and were gone. “They took our watches, rings, my wallet from my walk-in closet, our flat-screen TV and cash.” Once his wife, whose name he won’t disclose, gave him the all-clear, Govender unlocked the bedroom door to console her. “None of us were able to see if they arrived in a car but one can only assume that if a TV is being stolen, a vehicle was involved.” Govender said he was surprisingly calm and quite optimistic once the alarm was set off, knowing help was on its way. He said security officers arrived within 10 minutes. He said the children, aged 8 and 11, were still traumatised by the incident. “I am looking at taking them for post-traumatic counselling.” This was not the first time the Govenders were victims of a robbery. “Our home was broken into a while back but thankfully we weren’t home.” Despite having a fully-armed security system with outdoor beams, Govender plans to install surveillance cameras outside his property. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a case of house robbery was being investigated. No arrests had been made. POST
