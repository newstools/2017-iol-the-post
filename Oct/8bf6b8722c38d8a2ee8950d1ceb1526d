A new logo and colours will be revealed when it is relaunched in March. “The community can benefit from an upgraded centre providing an improved shopping experience. And the inclusion of a SuperSpar fulfils a need and desire that has been there for years. The Chatsworth Centre strives to ensure that shoppers’ needs are met through a diverse tenant mix,” said centre manager Keeran Govender. In addition to Spar, opens in November - situated on Level 2 next to Jet and Pravina’s Hair and Beauty Salon - the centre’s existing entrances will be upgraded with larger foyers. Shops fronts will have a more modern look and feel with perforated roller shutters as entrance doors. The centre will be retiled in Italian porcelain. New flush plastered ceilings/bulkheads are being installed throughout. There will also be light troughs and new LED lighting to improve the ambience. The latest revamp and store additions follows the centre’s expansion over the years. Phase 1 was a single level mall and Phase 3 took this to four levels. “In 1989, Checkers Warehouse anchored this development with a few line stores, and following our Phase 1, the demand for more retail space grew significantly and plans were put in place to launch a second phase of the centre. “The opening of the second phase introduced tenants such as Woolworths, Truworths, Markham, American Swiss and many more,” said Govender. “In August 1992, there was a demand for phenomenal growth, making way for The Hub and other line shops. The centre is a household name and a second home to some of the residents. It is the first of its kind to be opened in Chatsworth.” POST
