Durban - A Chatsworth resident is calling on the Chatsworth Centre management to take extra precautions during the revamp. The woman, who requested anonymity, told POST steel rods have been hanging from the roof of the mall for months. “It is very scary walking through there and when you look up, see it directly on top of you and how pointy and sharp it looks. You feel as though you are staring death in the face,” she said. “It’s concerning because as shoppers we go to the mall to have some fun, shop and be merry with our family members but here we are with our heads up watching to see if any of the beams fall and where it will fall.” The shopper, who visits the centre frequently, added it would be different if it was a mall outside of Chatsworth. “People won’t take a chance and leave it exposed and hanging at any mall in Hillcrest or at the Pavilion, but because it is the Chatsworth Centre, no one is bothered to cover it or take any precautions.” Centre manager Keeran Govender said the structure had been passed by all relevant officials and shoppers should not be concerned. “These structures have been passed by both the fire inspectors and the engineers overseeing the revamp. Certification has been provided in which the area has been deemed safe,” he said. “These structures have been put in place to provide support for the new suspended ceilings currently being installed.” POST
