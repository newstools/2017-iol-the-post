Durban - The two Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department officers seen in a video "lunching"on banknotes have been slapped with pre-suspension letters, the EMPD said on Friday. The video clip went viral on Friday. It shows the two EMPD traffic wardens in full uniform gyrating to loud music from the boot of a car with their lunch packs littered with banknotes. They are seen showing off with the banknotes which they use as serviettes and toothpicks.  "The two officers were identified, located and summoned to the EMPD Headquarters were they were served with pre-suspension letters this afternoon," said EMPD spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wilfred M. Kgasago. "As soon as the video came to the notice of management, the search for the two traffic wardens was launched and when located they appeared before the Chief of Police who immediately served them with pre-suspension letters. They have been instructed to appear before the Chief of Police on Tuesday, 31 October where they will be afforded the opportunity provide reasons why they should not be suspended," Kgasago said.
 
He said reasons for the pre-suspension were that the pair, based at Tokoza Precinct in the EMPD Southern Operational Region, put the council in disrepute as well as disobeyed "standing orders by way of their unprofessional conduct".    IOL
