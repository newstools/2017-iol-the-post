Chris Pappas, ward councillor for the area said as per 2015/2016 crime statistics, released earlier this week, there has been a spike in car jackings and house robberies in the Berea. “Despite the best efforts of the SAPS there are huge challenges in terms of resources; manpower and appropriate vehicles. Councillors are also tied in this regard as SAPS does not fall within the mandate of local government which means we have no authority on this regard,” he said. Pappas said while individual acts of bravery are inspiring he urged residents not to put themselves in harm's way. “Possessions can be replaced, lives cannot,” Pappas said. Daily News
