Letter - The December ANC elective conference is around the corner. Whoever is elected as leader must not take the baton from the current president and continue on the path to destruction created by him and his cronies that has led to the detriment of our country. This is in the form of widespread corruption, state capture and cronyism, among others. There are at least 30 million poor South Africans who go hungry every day. Imagine how the billions siphoned off the state coffers could have contributed to improve the lives of these underprivileged people. Projects such as housing, electrification, water and sanitation could have been funded. They in turn would have created thousands of much-needed jobs, thereby rejuvenating the stagnant economy. Imagine how many pupils or students could have had free education with this looted money to avoid the #FeesMustFall campaign that caused mayhem in the universities. Projects could also bring an end to service delivery protests occurring all over the country. People are getting impatient and if the current state of affairs continues, it would lead to anarchy long before the 2019 national elections. Let us hope those ANC members who are eligible to elect a new president will vote with their conscience in order to save South Africa. POST
