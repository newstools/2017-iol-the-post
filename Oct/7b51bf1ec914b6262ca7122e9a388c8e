Durban - A day after her second open-heart surgery last Tuesday, 5-month-old Zoe Naidu was smiling and playing in her hospital bed. Then she closed her eyes, forever. “She was the strongest baby I ever saw. She went through two open-heart surgeries and was put under anaesthetic four times. Even with the complications in her heart, she performed like any other child and never stopped fighting,” said her devastated dad, Bradley Naidu. At 4 days old, Zoe was diagnosed with hypo-plastic left heart syndrome, where the left side of the heart that carries blood to the brain has not fully developed. Zoe had her first open heart surgery at just 8 days old. In August, POST reported that little Zoe needed a heart transplant but could not get one as there is a small pool of potential donors. Such a transplant has not been performed on an infant in South Africa. In July it was found her aorta had become narrower and doctors had to perform a cardiac cap and ballooning to enlarge the main artery. Last month, the toddler went for the second stage of ballooning. Zoe’s heart stopped and she had to be resuscitated. But she recovered well in order for her to undergo last week’s surgery. Sadly, she did not make it. “I never saw strength like that in something so little and we always tell people to be brave when they go through a difficult situation, but our baby was born brave,” said her mom, Romona. “There was always something angelic about her and she had a calming nature.” The Johannesburg couple, formerly from Durban, said explaining Zoe’s death to her older sister, Sophia, had been tough. Bradley said their baby had touched a lot of people and inspired them with her journey. “People started believing in miracles and higher beings when they met our daughter or read her story. "She gave a lot of people strength and on her funeral day, we received a lot of strength from those people. "Hundreds of people came out to support us.” POST
