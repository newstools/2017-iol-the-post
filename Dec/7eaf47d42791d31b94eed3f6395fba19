Durban - A 71-year-old female pensioner was fatally strangled at her Arena Park, Chatsworth home, on Monday night.  It was the pensioner's daughter who made the gruesome discovery, when she arrived home from work at around 10pm, said Captain Cheryl Pillay from the Chatsworth SAPS.  Pillay said the daughter had noticed that the property gates at her Rose Heights Road home, had been derailed, and she contacted a security company for assistance.  "The elderly woman was strangled and her home was ransacked," said Pillay.  It is alleged that the pensioner had called someone to help her clean the windows when the incident occurred. Pillay urged residents to screen potential employees.  "Also ensure that you obtain a copy of the persons identity document before employing the person. Elderly persons should not be left alone at home with persons who are employed on a temporary basis.  "Criminals are opportunists who will attack the elderly as they are vulnerable and unable to defend themselves," she urged. A case of murder and house robbery is being investigated. No arrests had been made at the time of publication.  For the full story get your copy of POST.  POST
