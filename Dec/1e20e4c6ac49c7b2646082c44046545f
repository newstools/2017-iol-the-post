PHOENIX CHILD AND FAMILY WELFARE SOCIETY:  Saras Perumal said pupils and students could volunteer with the society’s children’s foundation, named the Phoenix Child Foundation - Children Taking Care of other Children. “The aim is to instil caring into our children, make them appreciate what they have and acknowledge others who are less fortunate,” said Perumal, the society’s president. Volunteers can teach the children to colour in and read, among other activities. Call the society at 031 500 3671.
