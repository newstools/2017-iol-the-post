Durban - It will be a bleak Christmas for the families of two Phoenix friends who died in a hit and run accident on the M4 last May. 
Apart from dealing with their deaths, they learnt that they would have to wait until January to hear the fate of the motorist allegedly responsible. That’s when the Durban Regional Court is expected to hand down judgment. Kearadilwe Refilwe Modise-Moloto was charged in connection with the deaths of Sumeer Maharaj, 26, and Pravin Mahabir, 25, who were assisting a friend on the side of the road. She faces two counts of culpable homicide, charges of failing to perform the duties of a driver after an accident, reckless and negligent driving, and defeating or obstructing the ends of justice. Maharaj’s mother, Naseema, said: “I was hoping to hear judgment before Christmas. We thought we would have some sort of closure but now we have to wait yet again... I am suffering with depression and high blood pressure and am in and out of hospital.” She continued: “This is a loss only a mother will understand and my life will never be the same. I just want justice to be served.” Magistrate Fariedha Mohamed heard final statements from prosecutor Nkosingiphile Manqele and defence counsel, advocate Mokotedi Mpshe, in a full courtroom. Manqele presented the original forensic reports from the accident scene and in her closing address said Moloto was guilty on all counts brought against her. The men were killed while helping a friend, Junaid Singh, change a flat tyre on his bakkie on May 18. Their cars were parked in the emergency lane on the M4 north, near the Blue Lagoon on-ramp, when the accused allegedly struck them with her black Kia. Singh survived, while Maharaj died at the scene and Mahabir succumbed to his injuries in hospital the following day. Moloto allegedly filed a false accident report and attempted to repair her car. The Durban North resident is currently out on bail. POST
