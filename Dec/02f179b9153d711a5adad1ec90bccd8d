Durban - The newly-elected president of the South African Tamil Federation is calling on youth to join the body that represents Tamilians in the country. 
Dr Mickey Chetty, who was announced as president on Saturday during the federation’s 20th Biennial General Meeting, said: “I have travelled to various countries and the youth are often at the forefront in their organisations. We do have some youth, who are enthusiastic to join the federation but we need many more. The youth are generally vibrant and have new and exciting ideas.” Chetty, who is also the president of the International Movement for Tamil Culture - South Africa, said he looked forward to once again leading the Tamil community to greater heights. He said members of the community and the trustees of the Merebank Tamil School Society approached him to stand as president and he had given his word that he would take over the helm.  However, he believes his newly elected deputy, Major General Bala Naidoo, will play a major role to strengthen and lead the organisation. The executive members are: Joint Secretaries, Mervyn Reddy and Phoomoney Naidoo, PRO Shirley Naran and treasurer Radha Pillay.  Chetty was instrumental in facilitating and securing Tamil textbooks for distribution at schools, where the language is being taught.  He has replaced Marie Pillay-Ramaya.
