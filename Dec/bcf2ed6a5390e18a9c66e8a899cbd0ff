Durban - The battered body of a 71-year-old Chatsworth woman, who was strangled during what is believed to be a house robbery, was found in her bedroom on Monday. It is believed that Dhevi Pather’s daughter made the gruesome discovery when she returned to their Arena Park home from work that evening. The driveway gates had been derailed, said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. The victim, he added, had sought the help of a security company. Police were still on the scene yesterday looking for clues. Traumatised neighbours looked on, with one saying they had not heard or seen any unusual activity at the home. Pather, he said, was a quiet and reserved woman. Another neighbour said he had seen a man arriving at the home and working in the yard. “In the past week, there was a man who would arrive early in the morning and he could be seen cleaning outside the house, the windows and yard,” he said, adding the murder had shocked the community. “This is very unexpected and cruel for the elderly to become soft targets of these brazen criminals. We are no longer safe in our own homes.” Police are appealing to residents to ensure that persons who are seeking temporary employment are screened before they are employed. Said Zwane: “Ensure that you obtain a copy of the person’s identity document before employing the person. Elderly persons should not be left alone at home with persons who are employed on a temporary basis,” he said. “Criminals are opportunists, who will attack the elderly as they are vulnerable and unable to defend themselves.” A case of murder and house robbery is being investigated. No arrests were made by the time of publication. Pather’s family could not be reached for comment. POST
