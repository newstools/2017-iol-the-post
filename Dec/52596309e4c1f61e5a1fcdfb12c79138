Durban - Two children were left traumatised after four men wearing black gloves held up an uMhlanga family at gunpoint during a robbery at their home on Monday afternoon. 
The suspects allegedly ransacked the house in Montague Drive, uMhlanga Ridge, taking jewellery, clothing, a handbag and an undisclosed amount of cash. The family, who own a fleet of buses, declined to comment yesterday. Rivaaj Ramdas of the Tactical Shooting Team, who responded to the incident, said the family was traumatised. “The suspects arrived in an Audi A4 and somehow managed to jam the gate. They entered the yard and held an elderly man, who was outside, at gunpoint. They took him inside and also held his female relative and two children at gunpoint.” Ramdas said the men demanded keys to the safe and other valuables. “Somehow the woman's son heard about the robbery and contacted me for help. While making my way to the scene, I contacted Reaction Unit South Africa, Inkosi Security and Marshall Security for help but before we arrived, the men had fled.” Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of house robbery was opened.
