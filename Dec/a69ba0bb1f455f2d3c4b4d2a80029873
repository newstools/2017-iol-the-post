Durban - Fondly referred to as the “golden buzzer girl”, 12-year-old SA’s Got Talent semi-finalist, Fazlyn Naidoo will take to the stage for the uMhlanga Carols under the Stars, at Granada Square on December 20. 
The singing sensation of Southgate, Phoenix, became famous for her jaw dropping performance on SA’s Got Talent (SAGT) when she sang Down by Marion Hill that earned her the “golden buzzer” and automatic entry into the semi-finals. Fazlyn will perform Christmas classics that include Mary Did You Know. “Christmas is my favourite season of the year and I am excited to be part of Carols under the Stars for the second time,” said Fazyln. The Grade 7 pupil, whose first performance was at the age of 4, has been in the limelight since she won Phoenix Got Talent last year. She performed at the Barnyard for Night of a Hundred Stars and at the Playhouse Theatre, as Louisa von Trapp, in the Sound of Music. Speaking about life after SAGT, Fazlyn said she was inundated with requests to perform. “I’ve definitely become more recognised as a singer because of the show but I still plan to continue working hard to make my dream, of being a professional singer, a reality.” Fazlyn is concentrating on developing her voice and plans to do more cover versions of hit songs as well as write music. “I hope to perform around the city, country and the world.” The chairperson of the uMhlanga Tourism Committee, Peter Rose said: “Being a part of a Carols Concert always is an uplifting way to start the festive season.” Violanist Pierre Frenzel will also perform on the night. Rose encouraged patrons to bring along a gift that would be donated to children less fortunate.The event is free and starts at 6pm, with a session of Christmas crafting. POST
