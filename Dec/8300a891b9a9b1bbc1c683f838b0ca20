Durban - A beauty business owner of Merebank was caught off-guard when television personality and radio host Bonang “QueenB” Matheba called her on Sunday wanting to have her nails done. Elvira Rajman, 28, the owner of Elite Nail and Beauty Studio, described the Revlon Cosmetics South Africa brand ambassador as “down-to-earth and gorgeous”. Rajman said a client’s former husband worked as Mathebe’s bodyguard and had passed on her details. “She called and asked if I could please do an emergency nail repair and change the colour of her overlays. I was so thrilled to meet her and instantly agreed.” Rajman dashed off to a Durban hotel where she met the A-lister and author of From A to B: Bonang Matheba. “She is really nice and I felt so comfortable.” Matheba opted for red to keep with the festive season cheer and to match her new favourite lip colour. Rajman started her beauty business five years ago, offering nail and waxing services as well as facials, and her clientele has grown from 20 to more than 200. “I pride myself in getting to know each client’s needs and ensuring they get what they asked for. And I love chatting with them and getting them to relax.” Matheba rated Rajman’s work as “fantastic”. “My nails broke and a friend recommended Elvira. She was so fantastic, affordable and quick. I am definitely going to be seeing her again.” POST
