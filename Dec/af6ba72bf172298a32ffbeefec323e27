Durban - For youth like Kajal Raghubir, 23, and Sundhir Singh, 18, volunteering to help those in need has become an integral part of their lives. For the past 15 years, Raghubir has been a volunteer at the Verulam Day and Frail Care Centre. An industrial psychologist, Raghubir said helping others made her value what she had. Her mom, Nisha, a social worker at the centre, encouraged her to spend her free time enhancing the lives of others. “I used to accompany my mom to the centre during the school holidays and if there was a social event, I would entertain the elderly by dancing. Later, I began helping in the kitchen and serving the residents their meals. I would also chat and go out on walks with them.” By showing compassion to others, Raghubir formed a bond with many of the senior citizens. “Some of them are retired principals and teachers with a wealth of knowledge to share.” She said it was vital for parents to encourage their children to pledge a week of their holidays to helping others. “The youth must be taught the importance of valuing what they have and volunteering can help do that.” Other than volunteering at the centre, she is also the secretary at the Rotaract Club of Verulam. “If there is a family in need in the community, we step in to help by distributing food hampers and blankets. We also run the environmental programme, Keep Verulam Beautiful.” From the age of 14, Sundhir, of Phoenix, started volunteering at the Sahara Shelter for Abused Women and Children. “When I saw the number of abused, orphaned and neglected children at the shelter my heart sank. "I knew then and there that I wanted do something to help them,” said Sundhir. “I visited the shelter two to three times a week and helped the children with their assignments and homework as well as to colour and read.” He said he fund-raised to buy the shelter bread and groceries. Sundhir is studying towards a BComm degree in marketing at the Richfield Institute of Technology. POST
