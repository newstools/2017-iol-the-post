You would need to email your creative, or authentic, samoosa filling halaal recipes to jaidene.moodley@inl.co.za. Based on the recipes, the judges will select 10 entrants. You would then need to make and take along 12 unfried samoosas to the venue - where it will be fried and presented to the judges. The person with the tastiest samoosa will win. Category two is the Fold the Samoosa challenge where new contestants will pit their skills against each other.
