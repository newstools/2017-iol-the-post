Durban - Almost a month after a 15-year-old Merebank boy was allegedly drugged and sexually abused by four older men, his family is battling to obtain justice after prosecutors declined to proceed with the matter. The Director of Public Prosecution in KZN, Advocate Moipone Noko, said the matter had not been enrolled due to insufficient evidence. There was no reasonable prospects of a successful prosecution, he said. The teenager’s infuriated mother said: “We just don’t understand what more evidence they need to go forward with the matter. Doctors reports have confirmed he was injured internally. “As a mother, to look at my son, who has been through such an ordeal, is heartbreaking and now we are told there will be no justice for him. What message does this send to other victims? “We will be acquiring the help of a lawyer to get justice. We will not let this matter rest until the perpetrators are brought to book. We want this case reinvestigated.” Read: Boy, 15, ‘drugged and abused’ The mother added that it was not fair that people are judging her son, who had consumed alcohol and for being out at night. The teenager was out with a female friend when a group of men, who appeared to know the girl, approached them. They allegedly asked the friend and boy to "chill" with them at a nearby house. He said drugs were later forced into his mouth, which resulted in him losing conciousness. The boy only remembers calling out for his grandmother to open his home’s front gate the following day. He later felt sharp pains when he attempted to use the toilet. His underwear had blood stains. Doctors said he had internal cuts and bruises. DNA samples were taken. POST
