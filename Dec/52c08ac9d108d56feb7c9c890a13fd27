Durban - The 44th president of the USA, Barack Obama had his audience in Dehli intrigued last night as he spoke about being the first American president with a recipe for dhall. Dhall - is a humble Indian dish which is made in many Indian homes. The former president was speaking during a question and answer session at the HT Leadership summit in Dehli, when he explainedÂ that the night before a waiter, who served him dhall the night before, began explaining how to make it. "I told him that he need not do so, since I knew how to make dhall and I have my own recipe which I learnt from my Indian roommate when I was a student." When asked whether he could make a chapati (roti), Obama said he could not. "Chapati is hard." POST
