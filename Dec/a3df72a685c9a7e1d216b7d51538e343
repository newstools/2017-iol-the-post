Letter - It is almost 23 years into democracy of a new government and we are still faced with radical oppression. 
This is something I ask myself: Has apartheid ended or not? What is really going on that we, as citizens of South Africa, don't know about? We have been hearing empty promises for too long from the opposition while the most corrupt leadership dissolves its nation. The scams and underground deals are costing us millions as taxpayers. I was recently faced with a horrible experience of being racially mocked for being an Indian. The security at the mall would not allow me in to use the ATM simply because I am an “Indian”. Awaiting an order for a take-out in the rain, I sat in the car for about 20 minutes until, surprisingly, I noticed the doors of the mall open to allow two young women, who were of a different race. Immediately, I approached the security guards and they ignored me. I tapped on the glass window to get their attention but they ignored my presence as if I was invisible. After some time they did come out and open the doors when they heard I was going to report their behaviour and inform the centre management. Sadly after so many years of struggle oppression, racism still exists. POST
