Durban - A young Phoenix couple accused of killing their neighbour last month, were recently denied bail in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. 
Abigail Pillay, of Quailpalm Road, and her boyfriend, Ashley Veerasamy of Stonepark Place, both 18, were arrested for the murder of 64-year-old Joshua Pillay.  The Desertpalm Road resident was bludgeoned with a spade, stabbed in the neck and left for dead. Pillay was hospitalised in a critical condition for a week until he succumbed to his injuries a few days later. The couple were arrested after a neighbour and community leader, Pastor Mervyn Reddy, provided police with CCTV footage taken from a camera mounted outside his home. The footage allegedly show the accused entering Joshua Pillay’s house and leaving with goods. The matter was adjourned to next month. POST
