Durban - For me, Christmas means expressing my love for one and all. I spread the love from one side and come away with it in different ways. 
Christmas morning I must put out a "please call me" to all my family and friends, so they can phone me back and I can wish them and let them know how much I love them. I also distribute parcels filled with my goodies house-to-house for the whole district. Whether I like my neighbour as myself or not, I give with an open heart. Mustn’t show face, especially Christmas time, you know why? As Bette Midler said in her song “God is watching us from a distance”. Plus I help the elderly. I give Uncle a good spring cleaning, scrubbing him from head to toe with the coir. I dress him up in my son’s old clothes, then we go visiting the old-age homes, giving gifts for the elderlies. But last year Uncle made me so cross, you see he was wearing my son’s red T-shirt and his beard was grown, so he saw an opportunity to trick the old ladies. He told the old ladies he is Christmas Father, so they must sit on his lap and take a snap! For me, Christmas is nice very nice, but it can be a headache too, bah. Whole family is parking here from morning till night because why? They like my hand food. So whole day I’m cooking and putting. And it’s okay if I’m just feeding my own family but Uncle’s sister Pathma, once she comes, we're finished, bah. It’s like shovelling food inside a vacuum cleaner. She’s a real guzzler. Eats nicely and talks behind my back. I always say, mustn’t bite the hand that feeds you! Anyway, I’m only telling because you asked, but it’s Christmas now, must let bygones be bygones, forgive and forget. It’s water under the bridge - and Padma is quite a big bridge! POST
