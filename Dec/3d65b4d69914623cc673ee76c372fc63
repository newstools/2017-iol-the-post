The legendary Indian playback star, who has more than 19000 Hindi songs under his recording belt, will perform live at the Durban International Convention Centre on December16 with TV maestro Rithvik Dhanjani. The event, hosted by Colors TV South Africa, is expected to draw thousands of Durbanites because Narayan has been described as the Ustad (expert musician) of Bollywood. Vinay Hansraj of Showtime Promotions, the event manager, said Narayan had created some of the best Bollywood music for the 1990s. “It’s rare to find an artist of such calibre. His concert is like playing a jukebox with songs that people have grown up with,” he said. Narayan has several awards to his name, including the prestigious Padma Bhushan, given to him by the Indian government after lending his voice to songs from movies such as Khabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. “He is among the singers who have built the Bollywood music industry as he worked well with movie stars of that time, who include Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and gave a voice to the songs they acted out on screen,” said Hansraj. He said the next concert had been designed for the Durban taste because organisers had hand-picked the local favourites of Narayan’s songs. Dhanjani is expected to add more flavour to the concert with stunning dance moves. He rose to fame with his role as Arjun Kirloskar in Pavitra Rishta and thereafter participated in several reality shows, including dance show Nach Baliye which he won. Concert tickets cost R300 per person and are available at Computicket. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
