The 32-year-old, who featured in plays by Dingalings Productions, died after his Kia Cerato and a truck collided on the N2 near the Westwood Mall on Thursday morning. David was returning to his home in Sherwood after dropping off friends in Phoenix. Hours earlier, a play titled Going Home, which he wrote, was performed by youth at his church’s annual Carols by Candlelight. His cousin, Darshan Naidoo, said: “Just a few hours earlier, we were laughing and joking and talking about the success of our church event. We never imagined he would not return home that night.” The director and group member of Dingalings Productions, Kumseela Naidoo, said they were devastated. “We just spent that Wednesday evening with him at his church’s event. He invited the entire team to attend. It was a beautiful show. He was such a talented man.” She said it was uncanny the play was titled Going Home. “The message shared was that people should live correctly and help their fellow man. It was his last message before he left to meet his Maker.” Hundreds of mourners attended his funeral at The Embassy Church in Mayville on Saturday. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated by Sydenham SAPS. POST
