Durban - Laudium businessman Omar Carrim, who was allegedly kidnapped on August 3, was reunited with his family on Monday evening. Carrim, who received medical attention at an undisclosed hospital, was allegedly kidnapped after leaving his workplace, Home Hyper, in Pretoria Central. His son, Abdullah, told POST yesterday morning that the family was “happy to have him back and we want to thank South Africans for all their assistance and prayers”. He declined to comment on the merits of the case. Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee said Carrim was released on Monday at about 10.30pm in Olifantsfontein. “We are most grateful to everyone and appeal for privacy to give the victim and his family the time and space to recover from the ordeal,” said Abramjee. A day after Carrim went missing, the family found his Mercedes C300 burnt near the R511 outside Atteridgeville, which led them to believe he was kidnapped. At the time, Abdullah said they had been very concerned about his health. “If you take out the head, how does the body go on? That is how we feel. My dad takes chronic medication before supper every day. He hasn’t taken it in days and we are beside ourselves with worry but more importantly, we are just trying to be strong. We have to be hopeful,” he had said. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo declined to comment. POST
