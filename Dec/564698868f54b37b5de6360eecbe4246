Durban - A recent study, published in the journal Neurology, found eating a serving or two of salad may keep your brain 11 years younger. Key ingredients that will also help to prevent dementia is spinach, kale and lettuce. The study found that people who ate at least one serving of green, leafy vegetables a day had a slower rate of decline on tests of memory and thinking skills than people who never or rarely ate these vegetables. Martha Clare Morris, from Rush University of Chicago said daily leafy green vegetables may be a simple way to foster your brain health. "Projections show sharp increases in the percentage of people with dementia as the oldest age groups continue to grow in number, so effective strategies to prevent dementia are critical," she said. The study, involved 960 people with an average age of 81 who did not have dementia and were followed for an average of 4.7 years. “Over 10 years of follow-up, the rate of decline for those who ate the most leafy greens was slower by 0.05 standardised units per year than the rate for those who ate the least leafy greens. "This difference was equivalent to being 11 years younger in age.The results remained valid after accounting for other factors that could affect brain health such as smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, education level and amount of physical and cognitive activities,” added Morris.
