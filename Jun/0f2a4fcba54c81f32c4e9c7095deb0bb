DURBAN – The three detainees who escaped from unlocked police cells at Empangeni police station are still on the run and are yet to be found, the police said on Wednesday.   SAPS spokesperson Nqobile Gwala said internal investigations are continuing to determine how the suspects managed to walk out of the cells.  The Sunday Tribune reported on Sunday that six detainees had escaped from the police cell at Empangeni Police Station when a police officer allegedly forgot to lock the doors leading to the exit of the station.  Three of the six detainees have been re-arrested, but three of them, including murder-accused Thanda Zulu, 32, are still at large. The other two escapees are Mxolisi Mbuyazi and Sandile Majola, who were initially arrested for shoplifting.  The family of the victims in which Zulu stands accused, are living in fear.  He escaped on the same day that he was denied bail in Mtunzini High Court.
