Durban - A Verulam farmer who was approached by two armed men on his farm on Wednesday believes he is being targeted, as he is currently embroiled in a high court battle. Manna Naidoo, who is also the ex mayor of Verulam, was at his home when he was confronted by two suspects in a white VW Polo. Reaction Unit director Prem Balram who went to the scene said both men attempted to lure Naidoo out of his residence and when he refused to exit, the suspects brandished firearms and tried to enter his home. "They fled when Naidoo locked his door and called for assistance. Reaction Officers traced the vehicle used and found that the white VW Polo with registration NU 47491 was hijacked in Hillcrest - KZN in March 2007." The vehicle and suspects were not recovered. According to Naidoo, he believes that the suspects intended to kill him as he is currently embroiled in a bitter High Court battle. A case has been opened at SAPS. POST
