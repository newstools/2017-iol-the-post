Durban - Today marks a year since a promising young woman’s life was ruthlessly snatched away, after she was gunned down outside her workplace in Rossburgh. 
A video captured on CCTV of 27-year-old Annelene Pillay, pictured, being shot, allegedly by her abusive ex-boyfriend, Tyone Pillay, 31, went viral. He was charged with murder and remains in custody at Westville Prison. His trial is expected to start in April. Pillay’s mother said there was not a minute that went by without her thinking about her daughter. “It's been a year since she left us, but to us, it feels like it just happened,” said Charmaine. “Every day is a struggle for us. All we do is talk about Anna. She is my first thought in the morning and my last at night. I still cannot believe she has been taken away. “We have to go through another Christmas without seeing her smile or hearing her laugh. It is painful for us.” Justice, she said, would not take the pain away or give them closure. “But it will give us peace of mind that her killer is behind bars.” Her husband, Lincoln, and remaining daughters, Crisan and Shantal, have rallied together to support each other. “The girls were close to Anneline and also cannot get over her death, and my husband is not the same person.” As the country commemorates 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children, Charmaine appealed to parents, especially mothers, to watch out for signs that their daughters were not in bad relationships. “Anna kept things to herself because she did not want us to worry, but during my last conversation with her, she told me she was scared. I remembered telling her to be strong. “If you have the slightest feeling that your child is in trouble, speak to them. Get them help.” POST
