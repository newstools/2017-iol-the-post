Letter - The eThekwini Municipality is said to develop a new crematorium in Phoenix that will assist in curbing the challenges faced by families during the unfortunate times of death. The parks, recreation and culture unit has now been mandated to enter into a lease agreement that will make provision for the inclusion of all funeral and crematorium businesses, for equitable service delivery. The approval of plans for the development of the facility is said to be provided by town planning offices within 12 months of submission. This is another victory for Phoenix as it is densely populated and there is no burial space in any of the surrounding sites. Furnaces at the Verulam crematorium are often out of order and families are left to wait long hours, which further adds to the difficulty of such a loss. The city must be commended for this initiative and the community can be assured that the Minority Front will continue to fight for the interests of the people. I encourage businesses and religious groups to get involved in this process, so as to create awareness. POST
