Durban - A 49-year-old Chatsworth mother of two said she was emotionally and psychologically abused by her now ex-husband for many years. 
“In 2005 I found out he had an affair and left him. But he began spreading rumours that I was the one who cheated and I looked like the bad person,” said the woman, who declined to be named. “He belittled me in front of family and put me down all the time. He made me feel worthless and it came to a point when I believed I was a bad person.” She said her husband then began stalking her. “I endured this for seven years until we were legally divorced.” Twelve years later and feeling stronger, she said she had noticed that most women nowadays refuse to see the bad in their partners. “We need to stop making excuses for them and stop going back to them. That is where the problem lies. If you are being abused, walk away and don’t turn back.” Another Phoenix woman said she was beaten so badly by her boyfriend that she almost lost her unborn child. “He used to come home drunk almost every night. Sometimes, I was afraid to even greet him,” she said. “One day when I had enough, I screamed at him to get his act together and he lost it. He pushed me to the ground and began hitting me. I almost lost consciousness. My mouth was bleeding and I could only open one eye. He walked out leaving me in that condition. I managed to pack my bags and left before he could return.” She sought help from a local church and got a restraining order against him, but refused to open a case of assault: “I still loved him, but knew I could not go back. Ten years have passed and thankfully he also sought help for his problem”. The woman said she had made a promise to herself not to enter into another abusive relationship. “I have taught my daughter the same.” Her advice to women in abusive relationships: “Get out and get help fast. Don’t stay in a relationship, hoping it will get better. As soon as a man believes he can hit you, it will never end.” POST
