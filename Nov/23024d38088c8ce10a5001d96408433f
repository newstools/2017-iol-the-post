Durban -  A 39 year old man who killed two of his girlfriends this year, for allegedly cheating, will spend 30 years in jail. Phumlani Khumalo Zondi was convicted and sentenced in the Pietermaritzburg High Court earlier this week, for two counts of murder. The first case was reported on March 18. The body of 40-year-old Sizakele Phakathi was found next to the footpath along Victory street, Dundee. Her throat was cut and her legs were tied with a black belt. The second case was reported on September 16, at Gladstone street, Dundee where the body of Sihle Dolly Mnguni , 28, was found in an open field with head injuries. Within two days after the second case, an intensive investigation headed by Dundee SAPS, resulted in the arrest of the accused. Police arrested Zondi at Avocca area just outside Dundee, where he had been hiding. Zondi was linked to both murder and charged accordingly. He remained in prison since his arrest and was denied bail at every court appearance. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, welcomed the sentence. “I commend the Dundee investigating team that gathered enough evidence that led to the conviction of the accused. His violent conduct is highly unacceptable and cannot be tolerated in our society. The sentence handed down to the accused will serve as a warning to other would-be criminals who are thinking of committing such crimes,” he said. POST
