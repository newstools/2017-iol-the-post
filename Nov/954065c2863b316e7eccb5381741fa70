Durban - The deadline for applications for the Know India Programme (KIP), where graduates and those pursuing their graduation can visit and learn about Indian society and culture, will close on November 19. The KIP is an engagement programme for diaspora youth of Indian origin and provides a forum for students and young professionals to share their views, expectations and experiences, and develop closer bonds with contemporary India. It is a 25-day orientation programme aimed at promoting awareness on different facets of life in India and the progress made by the country in various fields, including economic, industrial, education and culture. The selected participants would be provided with accommodation but would have to pay 10% of the cost of the return airline ticket before their departure. Those between 18 to 30 are eligible. Non-resident Indians are not eligible and applicants must speak English. The 45th KIP is expected to start from January 29 to February 22 next year, in the proposed partner state of Rajasthan, and the 46th programme from February 12 to March 8 in Madhya Pradesh.
