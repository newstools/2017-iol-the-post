Durban - To raise awareness and shine the spotlight on abuse during 16 Days of Activism, the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation has launched a hard-hitting, multi-national campaign, #BluePurpleBlack. 
The non-profit organisation hopes to empower victims and educate the public on women and child abuse. #BluePurpleBlack refers to the colours of the bruise - the most indicative symbol of abuse. The chief executive of the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation, Kim Martin, said: “It is important to remember that abuse is not always violent or physical. Bruises are multifaceted and span wide: physical, sexual, emotional, verbal, psychological, economic, intimidation, stalking, damage to property, isolation, irrational behaviour and bullying - all bruises. “We’re saying to men, perhaps you made a partner change her clothing because you deemed it too revealing, or groped a woman without consent in a nightclub. “Maybe you stayed silent when someone you knew was being abused. All of these are forms of abuse. They’re symptoms of the same ‘disease’, dehumanising and causing a fellow human-being to feel powerless.” Martin, an abuse survivor, said #BluePurpleBlack was an extension of the conversations which started as a result of #MeToo. “This time, we’re asking men to speak up too, through recognising their own behaviour and committing to call out abuse when they encounter it. It’s only through engaging in extensive dialogue that we will start to see a change.” The foundation is calling on people to wear blue, purple or black over the 16 Days to show support. POST
