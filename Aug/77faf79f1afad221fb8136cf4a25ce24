The ruling ANC fired outspoken MP Makhosi Khoza as chairperson of Parliament’s public service and administration portfolio committee on Thursday. In truth, it was something that should surprise no one. Dr Khoza has been outspoken in her unequivocal rejection of Jacob Zuma’s continued tenure as president. She did not hide this in the run-up to last Tuesday’s secret ballot, the eighth no confidence debate in the eighth year of Zuma’s tenure. This week ANC committee members boycotted the portfolio committee meeting in protest at her continued presence. On Thursday, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu announced that his office had been directed to remove her from her position due to the “irretrievable breakdown of relations” between Khoza and her fellow MPs. Mthembu noted that there had been many attempts to “counsel” Khoza, but to no avail. She will remain an MP pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing into her conduct. At an organisational level, the party’s decision is understandable. No party in Parliament, given that it is the party which selects and appoints MPs not constituent voters, can afford rogue members defying the instructions of the party and its whips. But Khoza is no ordinary MP and her disobedience, while vocal, is neither normal nor unique. There are many others like her, though none as vocal. Mthembu has warned that the ANC composition of the portfolio committee will be re-looked. This is normal practice, but in the context it looks like a witch-hunt; the acts of those affronted by a rebellion that was far more widespread than anyone dared to expect. There are many other high profile dissident ANC MPs who will be in the firing line - thiswill be no surprise after Thursday’s decision. The question is how far the ANC dare go to set party discipline in the party caucus and the cost for the broader organisation as the clock ticks down to the December elective conference. * Kevin Ritchie is Independent Media’s Gauteng regional editor.
